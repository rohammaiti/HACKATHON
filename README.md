About the project-This project runs on python programming language and its computer vision libraries like opencv, mediapipe and pyautogui to simulate a virtual mouse so that the dependency on the mouse can be reduced
to a great extent. We can use this program to simulate the virtual mouse to move and select without using the hardware mouse and increase and decrease the volume of our system very easily without using system settings.
Make sure you have the necessary python libraries installed to run this program. Dont run this program on any online ide as opencv is not supported there.
